## API Integration

### Current Implementation
- **Simulation Mode**: The application currently uses simulated emotion recognition
- **Random Results**: Generates realistic but random emotion probabilities
- **Processing Delay**: 2-second delay to simulate real API processing time

### Real API Integration
To connect to an actual emotion recognition API:

1. **Update the `simulateEmotionPrediction()` function** in `js/app.js`:
```javascript
async function performEmotionPrediction() {
    const formData = new FormData();
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('audioFile');
    formData.append('audio', fileInput.files[0]);
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/emotion-predict', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        });
        
        const result = await response.json();
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error('API request failed');
    }
}
```

2. **Expected API Response Format**:
```json
{
    "dominantEmotion": "happy",
    "confidence": 85.3,
    "probabilities": {
        "happy": 85.3,
        "neutral": 8.7,
        "sad": 3.2,
        "angry": 1.8,
        "fear": 0.6,
        "surprise": 0.3,
        "disgust": 0.1
    }
}
```

## Customization

### Themes and Styling
- Modify CSS variables in `styles.css` for color scheme changes
- Responsive breakpoints can be adjusted in the media queries
- Add custom animations by extending the existing keyframe definitions

### Adding New Emotions
1. Update the `emotions` array in the prediction simulation
2. Add corresponding icons in `getEmotionIcon()` function
3. Define colors in `getEmotionColor()` function
4. Update the emotion filter dropdown in `index.html`

### Additional Features
The codebase is structured to easily accommodate:
- User registration and profile editing
- Audio playback capabilities
- Data export functionality (CSV, PDF reports)
- Advanced analytics and trend visualization
- Multi-language support

## Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

### Partially Supported
- Internet Explorer 11 (with polyfills)
- Older mobile browsers

### Required Features
- ES6 JavaScript support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Local Storage API
- File API for uploads

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Session-based authentication using sessionStorage
- Client-side validation with server-side verification recommended
- CSRF protection should be implemented for production use

### Production Recommendations
1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **JWT Tokens**: Replace sessionStorage with secure JWT tokens
3. **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive server-side validation
4. **File Upload Security**: Add virus scanning and file type verification
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting for prediction endpoints

## Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Debounced search functionality
- Optimized CSS with minimal reflows

### Further Improvements
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Image compression for avatar uploads
- CDN integration for Chart.js library
- Bundle optimization with webpack or similar tools
