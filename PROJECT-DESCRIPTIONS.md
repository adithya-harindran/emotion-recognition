## Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)
```
"I've built a web application that transforms how we understand emotions in therapy. 

Think of it as Spotify for emotional data - users upload audio files from therapy sessions, and the app instantly shows them a visual breakdown of emotions detected, complete with confidence levels and beautiful charts.

The interface feels more like a wellness app than medical software, making complex emotional data accessible to everyone. It tracks progress over time, lets users search their history, and provides insights that were previously only available through expensive clinical tools.

It's built with modern web technologies, works on any device, and is ready to integrate with real machine learning backends. I've already created a working demo that anyone can try."

Subject: Introducing EmotionTracker - Making Therapy Data Visual

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something I've been working on that I think might interest you.

As someone involved in [mental health/therapy/research], you know how challenging it can be to objectively track emotional progress during therapy sessions. Most tools are either too clinical, too expensive, or simply not user-friendly.

I've built a web application that solves this problem by making emotion recognition technology accessible through a beautiful, intuitive interface. Users can upload audio files and instantly see detailed emotional analysis with interactive charts and progress tracking.

What makes this different:
- No technical knowledge required - as easy to use as any consumer app
- Works on any device with a web browser
- Provides actionable insights, not just raw data
- Designed specifically for therapy contexts

I'd love to get your thoughts on this. Would you be interested in trying a demo? It takes about 2 minutes to see the core functionality.

The live demo is available at [URL] with test credentials: demo/demo

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
